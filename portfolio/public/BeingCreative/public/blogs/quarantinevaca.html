            <h1>COVID-19 Is Not A Vacations</h1>
<p class="t">
    Nowadays the world is suffering in an infectious disease caused by a new virus which is Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19). This disease attacks our respiratory system (like the flu), the symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, fever, tiredness, and in a few cases, patients have to face low breathing problems. People may be sick with this virus in 1 to 14 days before developing these symptoms, and about 80% of people get rid of it without taking any special treatment but, rarely this disease may be serious or can be fatal.

</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
    <h2>How COVID-19 Comes?</h2>
    It's not come from the sky to the earth this virus also has its ancestors it is a subfamily of <em>Orthocoronavirinae</em> and there are many more like this. The first time it is discovered in 1960 in two humans and a chicken. Other members of this family have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HKU1 in 2005, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV) in 2019. Most of these have involved serious respiratory tract infections.
<br>

</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
    <h2>How COVID-19 Spread?</h2>
    This virus spreads through contact of bodies, whenever we shake hands and hug someone who suffers from fever this virus can transfer to the other person or through cough or sneeze. It also spread when you touch an object which has a virus so be careful to do this kind of activity.

</p>       
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>Is COVID-19 Dangerous For Everyone?</h2>
COVID-19 doesn't attack those who have a strong immune system (the organs of the body which provide resistance to infection) For example, they say it mostly attacks children of 5 years age and older people above 50 years of age.
<br><br>
But safety is better than cure so we all have to take care of ourselves. China and Italy have a more critical condition because of Chinese almost eat rice with dirty animal meat like dogs, cats, rats, etc and Italians only eat pizza they don't eat other food except for pizza.
<br>
</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>How To Make Immune System Strong?</h2>
To make the stronger immune system you have to follow some rules :
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Sleep more than 8 hours a day.</li>
    <li>Drink water or juices after  every 2 hours.</li>
<li>Wash your hands more frequently with sanitizer, soap or whatever.</li>
<li>Avoid junk food, like burgers, sandwiches, etc., available outside!</li>
<li>Eat Pulses (Daal Masur, moong, chana, mash, etc.)</li>
<li>Drink Milk and/or eat  Yogurt (Dahi).</li>
<li>All types of flours (Aata), like wheat, rice, maize, juar flours.</li>
<li>All types of vegetables, like carrots, bhindi, potatoes, tomatoes, turiyan, etc.</li>
<li>All types of fruits, like apples, bananas, strawberries, etc.</li>
<li>Eggs, fish and mutton meat.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br>
<p class="t">

    <li>Try out a new recipe</li>
    <li>Catch up on cores</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>What Was The Big Mistake We Are Doing:</h2>
The biggest mistake we all doing right now is we think that the Government closed all the schools and offices just for fun and relaxation, no it's not it's the main reason is to prevent those people from this virus who are not infected and healthy but we are planning parties at home, going to the long drive with family, making plans to stay our relatives home to spend summer vacations we are doing nonsense. We have to stay at home not for this that you are not infected because this virus grows where their lots of people gather that's why the Government closed all Restaurants, Clubs, Amusement Parks, and Marriage Banquet so, people stay home and stay healthy but look what we do so, please don't play with your lives and your relatives because we don't know what will happen tomorrow.

<br>
Social distancing is a better option for yet. We canâ€™t stop the virus, but together, we can slow it down. We must stay apart in every social setting, whether standing, sitting or shopping.

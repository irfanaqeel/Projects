            <br>
            <q>A person who really cares you doesn't drag you down. He inspire you to be better." - Irfan Aqeel</q>
            <br>
            Be with someone who does these following things for you, not all things at least a few of them. And I know this article is not related to my niche but I think many people thought that look is the only thing we need to love so it's true there are many other things we have to see.

            </p>    
<br>
<p class="t">
    <h2>1. Be with someone who importance to your presence.</h2>
    <br>
    Someone who values your presence more than his phone screen; someone who texts you without thinking that you don't text him. Be someone who holds your hand without afraid in the public cause you're more than of anyone for him. Someone who keeps in mind every single detail about you no matter how tiny that detail maybe, because it is about you.
<br>
</p>
<p class="t">
    <h2>2. Be with someone who is ready to face problems when it comes to you.</h2>
    <br>
    It doesn't matter even if he drove for hours and tired too much but only for you he forgets everything and comes to you whenever you stuck any kind of problem. Be with someone who puts you on first in the priority list. He/She never say you no whenever you need them, you asked or not.
<br>
</p>
<p class="t">
    <h2>3. Be with someone who inspires you to be best.</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/0at_yjYY497P6t6DmTXk1DyHCYNwusiVBrZk-Oed-wpcB1eozoER4PJlNSolysW035uMTJ7c0FC4rbWaMfqb9YFfPUGzCzxpHoqYUQFrBBq84YpMT2Ibgi2-n2jiHCocNTVN5dbLh8HGXjBZsz0N_tgcC0YvbNXIgIEhjzLfhw=w400-h265" id="img" alt="inspires">
    <br>
    Be with someone who wants you to be best and encourage you and never leaves you if you have any bad personality traits. They never compare you with others because for them you are the best and if you are bad at anything they just try to make you best at that thing.

</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
    <h2>4. Be with someone who takes care.</h2>
    <br>
    A person who never tired to look after you, who always sees you that you reached home safely or not, and ask you twice a day that, are you okay? Be with someone who stays with you through thick and thin without about himself.

</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>5. Be with someone who is not afraid to accept you.</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/WfSLR0rKxEXhSOSh_yMPT1ZLrzVIRvs9Ch34jSgZj_GDkY9PO9dUO35Odv12tXOWK7A9acWwZvk2GbmuQu8qLwlWgxH-BOlvk2BXWGvkKeWVbBsEwmR3is0e5RyPxIxFJuvye_zV3cwZSXfQiCXy_UkbPj3q3VQjjXzWDCeF83svrQSb1L8e=w400-h266" id="img" alt="she's mine">
<br>
Be with them who are honest to you, who accept you as a partner in front of his family, friends, and relatives and save your photos on phone and in a wallet to just tell that she's mine. Be with someone who is proud to have you, and you are not an option for them but a unique choice.

</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
    <h2>6. Be with someone who is honest to you.</h2>
    <br>
    Be with someone who never hesitates to express his feelings to you even if he wants to cry in front of you because he has faith in you, who is exactly himself when he is with you and tells you clearly about anything you ask with them.

</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>7. Be with someone who makes you feel special.</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/d9NCIu4yawCi9BQfWWxKa4sf4otiXMfWhE3uHKoO5Udq8rIYRhxNjs03umsgsjt1G0guwa8yd95e2uki2cbWAEykKEFg5HX4jCQ8_W1TbAWtDn1oGTZqEUPvCRkB_gLWibd5Lbg6m1QgZt0eIqcX1eR8s_CVLI6sxFZVxcn87ALBfyy7S2Fh=w400-h266" id="img" alt="special">
<br>
Even if you are in a room with many people but he just stares at you and thinking about you, and compliment you, and make you feel like most special. Be with someone who gives you the feeling that you're really important to him. And always try that he loves you in different unique styles.

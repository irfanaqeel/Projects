            <h1>Truths But I Can't Accept</h1>
            <p class="t">
                As we know that everyone has some really interesting truth by itself but we can't admit because there's an issue of our ego or maybe some shyness. Today I'll write about 7 truths that people often said to me and usually I avoid these.
<br>

<br>
I really feel like this when someone gives me these kinds of compliments I think that he is making me fool, I mean how? I don't believe that. But who can deny the destiny we all have to accept it, let's have a look what are the truths which people said to me. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>1. You Know What Matters In Life.</h2>
Everyone knows what matters in life and that's not a big deal. But some people don't know what is really important in life and for them freedom is everything.
<br>
<img width="850px" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505816014357-96b5ff457e9a?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=891&q=80" id="img" alt="life"> 
<br>
I don't stack, I believe in investigating and before something starts we should observe what is really in matters in life.
</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>2.  You Can Survive Anything.</h2>
<p class="t" style="font-family: cursive;">Shakepeare said: <q>Never expect anything from anyone because expectations always hurt.</q> And when you learn to survive alone you survive anything. 
</p>
<br>
<img width="850px" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1478119025579-5ec5b648d6e5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=889&q=80" id="img" alt="expectation hurts">
<br>
And this one I can admit and I can survive not really anything but must be something and I did.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <h2>3. You Are Loved Even When You Don't Get It.</h2>
    Yes, this is true I really loved with the bottom of my heart even I know that I won't get it back but my heart never listen, to anyone and this is not just my problem many people can admit this, 
<br>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512475035448-30460b25ffd4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80" id="img" alt="broken heart">
<br>
but they just pretending that they just don't care.
</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>4. You Will Never Cheat To Get Ahead.</h2>
Is it true that if you don't cheat you don't get ahead in life? I don't think it is true in my opinion it is a false statement, Yes, a lot of people cheat to get ahead. Sometimes it looks like cheating is helping them get ahead. 
<br>

<br>
If you think that I talk about cheating in a relationship then you think wrong cheating is not mattered in just relationship. It's about our whole life.
</p>            
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>5. You Won't Intentionally Hurt Anyone.</h2>
Yes, I don't intentionally hurt someone and why should I do this I mean why we hurt someone even there's a reason but we don't need to do this. 
<br>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526063402628-3cda107c8df7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=869&q=80" id="img" alt="hurt">
<br>
You can never hut him/her intentionally because your heart won't let you do that. Even if the other person doesn't love you back your heart will always try to keep then stay.
</p>
<br>
<p class="t">
<h2>6. You Have A Soft Heart.</h2>
What? Wait a minute! who told that I have a soft heart? bring him to me. Obviously, we give these kinds of reactions whenever someone told us that you have a soft heart. No, not at all I don't have a soft heart. 
<br>
<img width="850px" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/851553/pexels-photo-851553.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" id="img" alt="kind person">
<br>
I think I really have a soft corner but why should I admit it, I don't accept that but it's true and only one person changes my heart and I will always be with her whatever it takes. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <h2>7. You See The Good In Others.</h2>
    I believe in one thing never tell someone your good sides to make them stay, tell them your bad sides and see who really cares for you.
<br>
<img width="850px" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/653429/pexels-photo-653429.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" id="img" alt="inspire people">
<br>
I always appreciate people and see their good side even if they do something wrong but remember never demotivate someone, tell them you're good but you need to be best.
</p>
<br><br>Now, tell me which one of these truths your friend tells you and you can't admit.

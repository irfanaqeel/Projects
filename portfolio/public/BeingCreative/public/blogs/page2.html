            <h1>Reasons! Why You Are Not To Be Successful </h1>
            <p class="t">A few days ago on my Facebook page, a person asked me a question that you wrote an article 
              about 10 rules to become successful so what was the reason that we are not successful at all can you 
              tell me about it. Then I said Ok and I collect some points which are major reasons why we are not successful. 
            <br><br>
            <q>Unsuccessful people make decision based on their current situations,
               while successful people make decision based on where they want to be.</q>
               <br><br>
               There are six reasons why people not successful and complaining all the way.
            <br>
        </p>
            <br>
            <h2>1. They don't have a plan.</h2>
            <img id="img" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484480974693-6ca0a78fb36b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=752&q=80" alt="">
            <p class="t">The biggest problem of unsuccessful people is they don't have a plan and when you don't have a 
              plan your days turns into weeks, weeks turn into months, months turn into a year and before you know it you
              're looking back saying "I should have a plan". So plan daily not big just little, make a to-do list or write 
              color notes and put it on your cupboard so it reminds you your main focus of the day.
              <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h2>2. Setting the wrong focus.</h2>
            <p class="t"> Be careful of your focus...
            <br>
            <img id="img" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525119257764-35ca8b725677?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80" alt="">  
            <br>
            <q>"Don't spend your time focused on climbing a mountain only to discover you have climbed the wrong one." - Randall L. Ridd
            </q><br>
            After setting a goal it is very important to focus on the rights things which help you to achieve that 
            goal if you want to become a software engineer and you work on dispensary so you are just wasting your 
            time looking for a hawk in the ocean because it's impossible. 
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h2>3. They don't want to invest money.</h2>
            <img id="img" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579621970795-87facc2f976d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80" alt=""> 
            <p class="t">Everyone needs a person who always with them in their good and bad situations and never leaves and for the kids, their parents are so important. Sometimes they get nervous and that time they want their parents to say that they will always be there for them.    
            <br><br>
            <q>Investing in yourself is the best investment you can make.</q><br><br>
            Single source of income never becomes a second source of return if you want to earn more you need to invest according to your income in order to gain profitable returns. Invest little one day plant become a tree.
              <br>
          </p>
            <br>
            
            <h2>4. Excuse for everything.</h2>
                <q>If you can't make it good, make it look good. - Bill Gates</q><br>
            <p class="t">These people always looking for a reason and logic as to why they can't and why they 
              shouldn't. They are good at making lame excuses, they have a lack of imagination and always find ways
               to justify why something shouldn’t be but they never really try.    
              <br>
            <img id="img" src="https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/making-excuses-corinneswriting.gif" alt=""> 
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h2>5. Lack of passion to do anything.</h2>
            <q>You are what you are by what you believe - Oprah Winfrey</q><br>
            <p class="t">Basically, passion and work are two parallel things you work to get paid and your 
              passion is something which you practice for pleasure. But when you combine your passion as your
               work you will be the best in your work and you really enjoy what you are want to do.
            <br>

        </p><br>
            <h2>6. You are just lazy as F@#㉿</h2>
            <img id="img" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1422190441165-ec2956dc9ecc?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=667&q=80" alt="">    
            <br>
            <q>You are what you are by what you believe - Oprah Winfrey</q>
            <p class="t">Lazy people point the finger at others and make excuses for why things didn't happen.
               Actually, they are not lazy they just don't value time and when you mess with time, time messes back.
                So get up early and work because you can get more money but you can't get more time.

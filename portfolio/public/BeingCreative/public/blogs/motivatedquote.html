            <h1>Quotes That Will Make You Motivated</h1>
<p class="t" style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
    It's really hard to be motivated all the time because sometimes we have situations that break us by inside and we think that giving up is the better option yet. The enthusiasm of our body which is very high in the time of sunrise getting low at the time of sunset, but we have to do some extra stuff to achieve our goals.

        Before giving up just ask a question to yourself that why you start? How did you think that you are worthy for it once you get the answers you will find your way.

I agree that is important to set goals in life but it is more important to set goals that are more unattainable to achieve. You live only once you don't waste it to set goals which are easy to achieve think big. There's another saying that "Shoot for the moon and you might hit the stars".I will not follow where the path may lead, but I will go where there is no path.

<br>
Setting a goal in life is the most important thing and when you set it you halfway reached your goal. You know what your aim of life and what you want to be. Goal-setting is a useful and tried-and-tested way of working toward achieving something specific. They are often referred to as stepping stones towards your purpose.

 <q>Plans are nothing; planning is everything.</q>-Dwight D. Eisenhower
            <br>

It is more important to know the difference between Plan VS Planning. The plan is just a documentation of your planning while planning is an active way of discussing the goals, objectives, strategies, and tasks that we need to accomplish. Plans need to update on a regular base.

Your life is too short so please don't waste it to think that what other people say about you and your life because if you think what other people think so what other people think and that is not really your business so live your life in your own way and believe yourself, and one day you'll say I did it.
